# autowinscript-proxmox
Proxmox script to automatically pull the Windows Server 2022 Eval iso into your local datastore, create a VM, download and mount the iso for VirtIO drivers, bot the system and ready for a quick install. Good for building and rebuilding Active Directory over and over until you just give up.
